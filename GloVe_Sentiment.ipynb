        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is the process of categorizing opinions in natural language text. Several methods can be used to estimate sentiment. In this example, labeled reviews from Yelp, Amazon, and IMDB are used to train a supervised binary classification model. The model is a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN). While 2D CNNs are commonly used for image classification, their exceptional spatial capabilities can applied to text in one dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "Words in a sentence must be encoded as vectors for training and prediction. This encoding is more commonly called embedding. A straightforward approach would assign every distinct word a unique numerical value. A better approach is use pretrained word embeddings based on a large corpus of text, such as Wikipedia. Global Vectors for Word Representation ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) is a popular vector representation based on word co-occurance.\n"
